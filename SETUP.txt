This project runs under any web server such as the one hosted by Apache.
See how to set up WAMP for Windows at (www.wampserver.com) or MAMP for MAC at (www.mamp.info)

Next add the three-D-Calendar directory under the virtual host directory, existing
in the location of where you had setup your server.

Finally, download the jquery library (http://jquery.com/download/) and the WebGL helper library
(https://github.com/toji/gl-matrix) and add the downloaded files:
glMatrix-[version-x].min.js, jquery-[version-x].min.js to your three-D-Calendar/lib directory.
